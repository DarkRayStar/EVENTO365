#### Brief Description of Project - 

Evento 365 event management system should plan and effectively manage the events such as Weddings, Birthdays, Meetups, and Housewarming ceremonies etc...
Users can also purchase any party/event-related items from their store and get them delivered.
With this web application, user can save their precious time, because they can access any information regarding events and online book on user choice and do the payments.
Using Evento 365 customers can easily access the best they want in one place
and this system also gives their customers the ability to handle their party needs easily during this pandemic situation.
So that we broke out an idea of making a web application that includes all needful for food, locations, photography, equipment, vehicle renting, dress, jewelry renting, and much more services for a grand event.
These overall increases management productivity reduces manpower and proves to be an economically long run.
